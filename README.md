# distance_vector_routing_protocol_simulation
Implementing distance vector routing protocol  , to determine least cost paths for network packets

Simulating routers as threads of process and will communicate with each other through message passing with the help of 
global shared buffer queue 

Algorithm : Bellman fords algorithm
